# Kata Friends Home API Integration

A system that detects SwitchBot Kata Friends events via BLE and forwards them to a home API server.
Local API authentication has been reverse-engineered, enabling access to photos and face recognition data.

## Device Info

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Device Name | KATA Friends |
| BLE Name | WoAIPE (WonderLabs AI Pet) |
| Manufacturer | Woan Technology (Shenzhen) |
| BLE Manufacturer ID | 2409 (SwitchBot/WonderLabs) |
| SwitchBot API deviceId | See .env |
| Wi-Fi IP | See .env |
| Wi-Fi | Connected to 2.4GHz band |
| OS | Linux 6.1.99 aarch64 (Android-based, hostname: WlabRobot) |
| QR Code (back panel) | Present (manufacturing serial number) |

## Findings

### 1. Wi-Fi Traffic

Almost no internet communication. Voice recognition and camera results are not sent to the cloud.

### 2. SwitchBot Official API (v1.1)

| Endpoint | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1.1/devices` | Listed as "KATA Friends", but `deviceType` field is missing (present for other devices) |
| `GET /v1.1/devices/{id}/status` | `statusCode: 100` (success) but body is empty `{}` |
| Webhook | Registration succeeds but no events are sent from Kata Friends |

Auth: HMAC-SHA256 signature (implemented in `setup_webhook.py`)

### 3. Local API (Auth Solved)

Kata Friends runs an HTTP server on LAN. The port is dynamically assigned via MQTT.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Endpoint | `POST /thing_model/func_request` |
| Health check | `POST /heartbeat` |
| Port | 27999 (dynamically distributed via MQTT; was previously 22090) |
| Auth | `auth: MD5(body + token)` |
| Token | Distributed via MQTT (stored in .env) |
| Status | **Working** |

#### Authentication Method

```
auth = MD5(request_body + token)
```

- The token is a UUID distributed by the device to SwitchBot cloud via MQTT
- Retrieved via ADB from device logs: `cc_mqtt.*.log`, `functionID:1021` messages
- For empty body (heartbeat): `auth = MD5(token)`

#### How Auth Was Reverse-Engineered

1. Captured iPhone app traffic via mitmproxy — confirmed auth header is MD5 format (32 hex chars)
2. Heartbeat requests (empty body) always produce the same auth — ruled out timestamp-based generation
3. Connected via ADB (port 5555 open) with root access — found token in device logs
4. Verified `auth = MD5(body + token)` matches all captured requests

#### Available Functions

| functionID | Function | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 9206 | Storage info | Verified (64MB total, 2MB used) |
| 9217 | Photo timeline (with face recognition) | Verified (176 photos retrieved) |
| 9225 | Face recognition data (registered/unregistered) | Verified (3 registered + 16 unregistered) |

Request format:
```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "code": 3,
  "deviceID": "<KATA_DEVICE_ID>",
  "payload": {
    "functionID": 9206,
    "requestID": "UUID",
    "timestamp": 1709500000000,
    "params": {}
  }
}
```

### 4. Device Internals (via ADB)

ADB debugging is always enabled on port 5555 with no authentication required. Root shell access is available directly from Mac — no SwitchBot app or proxy needed. Just requires the device to be on the same Wi-Fi network.

```bash
# Install adb if needed
brew install android-platform-tools

# Connect (no auth, root access)
adb connect <KATA_IP>:5555
adb shell    # Opens root shell directly
```

```

### 5. BLE Advertisement (Working)

State changes can be passively detected. The current system uses this method.

```
xxxxxxxxxxxx | 4c | 01 | 2132 | 0010 | 39 | 00
[  MAC  6B ] |seq | ?? | fixed | fixed |b12 |b13
```

| Byte | Content | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0-5 | BLE MAC address | Fixed |
| 6 | Sequence number | Increments per request |
| 7 | Unknown | Always 01 |
| 8-9 | Unknown | Always 2132 |
| 10-11 | Unknown | Always 0010 |
| 12 | Action counter | Decrements on action execution |
| 13 | Interaction flag | 00=idle, 03=voice responding |

### 6. BLE GATT

Has SwitchBot standard service `cba20d00-224d-11e6-9fb8-0002a5d5c51b`. Write characteristic (cba20002) and Notify characteristic (cba20003) available. No push notifications — request-response only.

Only `0x57` prefix responds (`0x56`, `0x58`, `0x01`, etc. yield nothing). Full 0x5700-0x57FF brute-force completed with `ble_brute.py`.

| Command | Response | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| 0x5700 | `01` | OK response only |
| 0x5701 | `05` | Not supported |
| 0x5702 | `01 64 19` | 01=OK, 64=battery 100%?, 19=state value |
| 0x5703 | `05` | Not supported |
| 0x5704 | `01 02` | Unknown (2-byte response) |
| 0x5705-0x57FF | No response | — |

## Current Detection Capabilities

### What Can Be Detected

- **Interaction start**: byte[13] changes 00→03 (voice command detected)
- **Interaction end**: byte[13] changes 03→00
- **Action execution**: byte[12] decrements (dance, photo, etc.)
- **Photo list**: Via local API (auth solved)
- **Face recognition data**: Registered/unregistered face list (via local API)
- **Storage info**: Usage and capacity (via local API)
- **Device internals**: Filesystem and log access via ADB

### What Cannot Be Detected

- **Voice recognition text**: Processed entirely on-device, not sent externally
- **Command type**: Unknown what was instructed (only whether it reacted)

## Scripts

### Main System

#### ble_watcher.py

Monitors BLE advertisements, detects Kata Friends state changes, and sends events to the API server.

```bash
python3 ble_watcher.py
```

Events sent:
- `interaction_start` — Voice command detected (byte[13]: 00→03)
- `interaction_end` — Response finished (byte[13]: 03→00)
- `action` — Action executed (byte[12] decrements)

#### home_api/main.py

FastAPI server that receives events from the BLE monitor. Events are logged to `logs/kata_events.jsonl`.

```bash
python3 -m uvicorn home_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
```

Endpoints:
- `POST /events` — Receive events
- `GET /health` — Health check

#### scripts/kata_local_api.py

Local API client for Kata Friends. Retrieves photos, face recognition data, and storage info.

Auth method: `auth = MD5(body + token)` (uses `KATA_LOCAL_TOKEN` from `.env`)

```bash
python3 scripts/kata_local_api.py storage    # Storage info
python3 scripts/kata_local_api.py photos     # Photo list (with thumbnail URLs)
python3 scripts/kata_local_api.py faces      # Face recognition data
python3 scripts/kata_local_api.py discover   # Scan functionIDs
python3 scripts/kata_local_api.py raw <ID>   # Arbitrary functionID
```

### Investigation & Debug Scripts

python3 scripts/ble_brute.py --prefix 01  # 0x0100-0x01FF
```

#### proxy/capture_auth.py

mitmweb addon script for capturing traffic between iPhone SwitchBot app and Kata Friends, with auth header verification.

```bash
mitmweb -s proxy/capture_auth.py -p 8888 --set connection_strategy=lazy
```

#### scripts/setup_webhook.py

SwitchBot official API (v1.1) webhook management. Requires `SWITCHBOT_TOKEN` and `SWITCHBOT_SECRET` in `.env`.

```bash
python3 scripts/setup_webhook.py setup <webhook_url>  # Register webhook
python3 scripts/setup_webhook.py query                 # Check status
python3 scripts/setup_webhook.py delete                # Delete webhook
```

### Network Investigation Scripts

```

## Next Steps

| Approach | Description | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
| Mac microphone | Use BLE detection as trigger to record with Mac's mic → speech recognition via Whisper etc. | Low |
| Local API functionID scan | Use `kata_local_api.py discover` to find unknown functionIDs | Low |
| ADB deep investigation | Further explore application code and config files on device | Low |
| LLM server integration | Send commands directly to the RKLLM server on port 8080 | Medium |
| Firmware analysis | Detailed analysis of device binaries | High |
